1. Inside your `Responsive-Portfolio` folder, find your `styles.css` file. You will write your media queries at the bottom of `styles.css`.

2. Use three `@media screen` tags, each with one of these `max-width`s: `980px`, `768px` and `640px`.

   * You use `980px` because you never want any of the content to be cut off. Since the desktop layout is about 960px wide,
     you want the media queries to kick in before your content gets cut off.

   * `768px` is about the width of a tablet and `640px` is about the width of a phone in landscape.

3. Make the layout match the following screenshots:

4. `index.html`: [980px](Images/980-index.jpg), [768px](Images/768-index.jpg), [640px](Images/640-index.jpg)

5. `portfolio.html`: [980px](Images/980-portfolio.jpg), [768px](Images/768-portfolio.jpg), [640px](Images/640-portfolio.jpg)

6. `contact.html`: [980px](Images/980-contact.jpg), [768px](Images/768-contact.jpg), [640px](Images/640-contact.jpg)

7. Make the position of the header `static` (the default positioning) when the screen is `640px` wide. The header design takes
   up a lot of room; you don't want it to stick to the top of a small screen and leave no room for the rest of your site.

8. Be sure to include the `viewport` tag in all your HTML files, otherwise your media-queries won't function as expected on mobile devices.
   _(Hint: You won't need to use exact pixels for anything other than the container)_

9. **Protip**: Use the Chrome extensions
        [Window Resizer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/window-resizer/kkelicaakdanhinjdeammmilcgefonfh)
    and [Browser Width](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/browser-width/mlnegepkjlccabakompdmbcmdieaideh)
    to see the browser dimensions in Chrome.

10. Deploy your new portfolio (now with media queries!) to GitHub Pages.

            <img src="assets/images/Me.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Larry S. Peteet">

            <p>
                I started a full-time Web Development Boot Camp at University of Central Florida (UCF) on August 14th, 2017 which lasts through mid-November.</p>
            <p>
                20 years of experience as an Independent Consultant with .NET (VB/C#), Databases (SQL Server/Oracle) as well as ASP.NET, Web Services with less experience in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript and the Web UI/UX space.
            </p>

            <p>
                The reason I am taking this Sabbatical is so I can take the time to immerse myself in a lot of the different UI/UX technologies.  The 12-week M-F 9:30-3:30 (plus a lot of time/work outside class) covers the following which I am seeing more and more on requirements/positives in positions shared with me:
            </p>
            <!-- <ul class="custom-bullet"> -->
            <ul class="custom-bullet">
                <li>JavaScript, JQuery</li>
                <li>RESTful APIs, JSON, AJAX</li>
                <li>Node.js, React.js, Express.js</li>
                <li>MySQL, MongoDB</li>
                <li>MERN, Node, Mobile Development, Facebook's React technologies, REMN applications</li>
                <li>PHP, Laravel, MVC framework</li>
                <li>And More</li>
            </ul>
            <p>                
                I am very excited about this and will then truly be a Full-Stack Developer.    Feel free to reach out to me in the future if so inclined.

                Kindly,

                Larry S. Peteet

            <p>
                I am currently in Orlando, Florida as I am attending Web Development Boot Camp currently.  Since I have a Motorhome/RV: I can relocate very easily if there is an RV Park/Resort near enough to commute from which in most location in Florida that is not an issue.</p>
